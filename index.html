        <div class="box" style="background-image: url('one.jpg');"><h1>Boston Celtics</h1><p>The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century.</p></div>
        <div class="box" style="background-image: url('two.jpg');"><h1>Milwaukee Bucks</h1><p>A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating. While the most-voted fan entry was the Robins, named for Wisconsin's state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the Bucks, which was a reference to Wisconsin's official wild animal, the white-tailed deer.</p></div>
        <div class="box" style="background-image: url('gs.jpg');"><h1>Golden State Warriors</h1><p>Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. The history of the Golden State Warriors began in Philadelphia in 1946. In 1962, the franchise was relocated to San Francisco, California and became known as the San Francisco Warriors until 1971, when its name was changed to the current Golden State Warriors.</p></div>
        <div class="box" style="background-image: url('lal.jpg');"><h1>Los Angeles Lakers</h1><p>The franchise that would become the Lakers was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1947 the team moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and its name was changed to the Lakers to reflect the Minnesota state nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes.</p></div>
        <div class="box" style="background-image: url('five.jpg');"><h1>Dallas Mavericks</h1><p>The Mavericks have won one NBA championship (2011). The Mavericks were founded in 1980 and, like most expansion teams, struggled in their first seasons in the NBA. The team plays its home games at the American Airlines Center, which it shares with the NHL's Dallas Stars. Dirk Nowitzki has posted the most career points for the Mavericks, with 31,560 points. </p></div>
